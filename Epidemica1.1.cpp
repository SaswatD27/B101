/*Now, the list of continental bonuses- what benefit do you get for starting on a continent? (This bonus remains constant throughout the game; does not change when you shift continents)
1. Africa: At the beginning of the game, there is a  15% chance that the BCR will decrease by 1.
2. Asia: At each mutation, there is a 25% chance that you will get an extra mutation.
3. Europe (Challenge Mode): BER decreases by 5 each time you receive a mutation.
4. Oceania: There is a 15% chance that all biome resistances are neglected.
5. North America: At each colonization of a new biome, there is a 5% chance that you will colonize another region. 
6. South America: If BER becomes zero, there is a 25% chance that you will be revived ONCE with a BER of 10.*/
